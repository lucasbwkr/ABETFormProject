## What has been done:
  1) Created the initial web app using Flask. 
  2) Created a database using SQLite which can be used in the future to store results.
  3) This boilerplate uses a virtualenv. To get the virtualenv running on your system you need to activate it.
  
      `source /CS4273Project/env/bin/activate`
      should do the trick.
      
      Your terminal should look like this after activating it.
      
      `(env) /path/to/your/project`
  4) The page has not yet been implemented as this is a skeleton to get started.
